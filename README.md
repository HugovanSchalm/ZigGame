# About
This project is an exploration of designing a game using OpenGL and Zig. 
I do not have an idea for a full game, thus there are no plans to make a final product from this project.

# Requirements
- Zig 0.14.1
- SDL3
- OpenGL 3.3

# Running
The project can be compiled and ran by using the following command inside any folder of the project.
```
zig build run
```
